# Group Registration Form

This project serves as a test for using Next.js API routes with Airtable. It was created to manage the registration of groups in my class.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and [this starter](https://github.com/dalbitresb12/next-typescript-tailwind-starter).

## Getting Started

You can start by running the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing any file under `src/`. The page auto-updates as you edit the files.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/](http://localhost:3000/api/). The different endpoints can be edited with the files under `src/pages/api/`.

The `src/pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Deploy on Vercel
